# Similarity-Boosted Hybrid Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SB H-CRBM) for drug-target interaction prediction

This is the source code for my Master's degree thesis program. The aim of this program is to predict the drug-target interactions in a multidimensional network.
It is an extension of the paper `Predicting drug-target interactions using restricted Boltzmann machines` by `Wang Yuhao and Zeng Jianyang`. The main purpose of this
work is to integrate correlations between drugs and both drug-drug and target-target similarity in the prediction.
